<h1>Rabbit</h1>
<img width="165" height="165" align="right" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/Rabbit-EnglishPatchSaturn/blob/main/images/cover.png?raw=true">English translation patch for the fighting game "Rabbit" on the Sega Saturn.
<br><br>
"Rabbit" is a 2D fighting game with cartoonish and colorful graphics. The game features eight playable characters: Wu-ling (rabbit), Tian-ren (hawk), Egith (ox), Hou-en (wolf), Ja-koh (snake), Yu-lan (fox), Rex (tiger), and Eddy (wild boar). Each character has a special animal spirit that aids them during combat, accompanied by a "BEAST" meter indicating when the player can use each unique special attack.
<br><br>
Once the player has chosen their hero, they must defeat all eight opponents, including the final boss Zao-long.
<br><br>

<h2>Cheat Mode</h2>
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/Rabbit-EnglishPatchSaturn/blob/main/images/options.png?raw=true" width="290" height="218">In "Rabbit" there exists numerous unlockable options only accessible to players after beating the game one or more times (depending on the option). As part of this English translation patch, these supplemental options have been enabled by default.
<br><br>
Additionally, the behavior of one of these extra options ("DAMAGE") has been modified. Originally, setting "DAMAGE" to "OFF" made both player one and two invincible. However, players of this patch will now find that turning this setting to "OFF" provides unlimited health for player one only.
<br><br>
This is particularly useful for those who want to experience each of the eight characters' end-of-game cutscene events without the effort of defeating every opponent along the way.
