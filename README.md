<br><br>
"Rabbit" is a 2D fighting game with cartoonish and colorful graphics. The game features eight playable characters: Wu-ling (rabbit), Tien-ren (hawk), Egith (ox), Hou-en (wolf), Ja-koh (snake), Yu-lan (fox), Rex (tiger), and Eddy (wild boar). Once the player has chosen theire hero, they must defeat all eight opponents, including the final boss Zao-long.
<br><br>
Each character has a special animal spirit that aids them during combat, accompanied by a spirit bar indicating when the player can use each unique special attack.
